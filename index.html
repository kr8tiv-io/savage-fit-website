                        <p>Hey, I'm <strong>Xenia</strong> — IFBB Pro, lifelong athlete, and your new favorite coach.</p>
                        <p>I didn't build Savage Fit to be another generic fitness brand.<br>I built it because I was sick of watching women:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Starve themselves trying to "tone up"</li>
                            <li>Waste hours on cardio and never see muscle definition</li>
                            <li>Feel intimidated in the gym because no one taught them how to lift properly</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Here's what I believe:</h3>
                        <p>Lifting weights doesn't make you bulky. It makes you <em>powerful</em>.<br>Eating enough doesn't make you fat. It <em>fuels your transformation</em>.<br>And strength training isn't just about aesthetics — it's about becoming the most confident, capable version of yourself.</p>
                        <p>I've spent 8+ years coaching over 1,000 women — from total beginners to competitive athletes.<br>I've learned what works. What doesn't. And how to build programs that fit YOUR life, YOUR body, YOUR goals.</p>

                        <p><strong>Savage Society</strong> is your all-access pass to workouts, community, and monthly programming. It's self-guided — you choose the programs, follow the plan, and connect with the community.</p>
                        <p><strong>1-on-1 Coaching</strong> is fully customized. I design your training and nutrition plan specifically for your body, goals, and schedule. You get direct access to me, bi-weekly calls, and hands-on coaching.</p>
                        <p><strong>Think of it this way:</strong><br>Savage Society = Netflix (unlimited content, you choose what to watch)<br>1-on-1 Coaching = Private chef (everything is made for you)</p>

                        <p><strong>Both!</strong> Savage Society includes gym-based programs (full equipment access), home workout programs (minimal equipment — dumbbells, resistance bands, bodyweight), and hybrid programs (mix of both).

                        <p><strong>Yes — and that's the entire point.</strong> Body recomposition (losing fat while gaining muscle) is 100% possible, especially for beginners and intermediate lifters. My programs are designed to build lean muscle through progressive strength training, burn fat through a slight caloric deficit (WITHOUT starvation), and preserve muscle while cutting. Inside Savage Society and 1-on-1 Coaching, you'll get the exact training + nutrition framework to make it happen.</p>

                        <p><strong>Here's the honest answer:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Strength gains:</strong> 2-4 weeks (you'll feel stronger before you look different)</li>
                            <li><strong>Visible muscle definition:</strong> 6-8 weeks (if you're consistent with training + nutrition)</li>
                            <li><strong>Significant body transformation:</strong> 12-16 weeks (this is when people start asking what you're doing)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>The key:</strong> Consistency. Show up. Trust the process. Don't quit after 3 weeks. Most of my clients who stick with it for 3-6 months see transformations that blow their minds.</p>

                        <p><strong>No.</strong> I don't believe in restrictive, miserable diets. You'll never hear me say "no carbs" or "eat chicken and broccoli 6x a day." Here's what I DO believe in: eating enough protein to build muscle, eating enough calories to fuel your workouts, and finding a nutrition approach that fits YOUR life (flexible, sustainable, enjoyable). Savage Society members get general nutrition guidance (macros, meal timing, food quality). 1-on-1 clients get fully customized meal plans. But either way — <strong>no starvation, no guilt, no BS.</strong></p>
