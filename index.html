            I didn't build Savage Fit to be another generic fitness brand. I built it because I was 
            sick of watching women starve themselves, waste hours on cardio, and feel intimidated 
            in gyms designed for men.

            Lifting weights doesn't make you bulky — it makes you powerful. Eating enough doesn't 
            make you fat — it fuels your transformation. And strength training isn't just about 
            aesthetics. It's about becoming the most confident, capable version of yourself.

            I finally have abs AND I can deadlift 225 lbs. I never thought I'd be 'that girl'

            actually enjoy training.
